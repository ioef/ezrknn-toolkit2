# ezrknn-toolkit2
This repo tries to make RKNN Toolkit 2 install easier and more organised. RKNN Toolkit is the software used for testing and using the NPU inside Rockchip's chips like the RK3588 found in the Orange Pi 5 and Radxa Rock 5.
This repo installs easily the utilities for running AI with the NPU on the boards, it does not install the Android utilities, simulator, server... 

Main repo is https://github.com/Pelochus/ezrknpu where you can find more instructions, documentation... for general use.

## Requirements
Keep in mind this repo is focused for:
- Only installing what's needed for Linux and running on the SBCs, not the simulator, server and other tools.
- ARM64 devices, focusing mainly on RK3588, but it should work on other RK SoCs.
- You are running either Debian 11 or Ubuntu 22.04 or later versions. Derivatives should possibly work fine too.
- Possibly will work better on not heavily modified OS installations (i.e. not using an older Python version or too recent)

## Quick Install
First clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pelochus/ezrknn-toolkit2
```

Then run:

```bash
cd ezrknn-toolkit2 && bash install.sh
```

## Test
Run (cd is required):

```bash
cd rknn-toolkit-lite2/examples/resnet18
python3 test.py
```

It should output this:

```

This doesn't use the NPU. Check this issue to actually test NPU usage: https://github.com/Pelochus/ezrknn-toolkit2/issues/2

# Description
  RKNN software stack can help users to quickly deploy AI models to Rockchip chips. The overall framework is as follows:

        <div style="background-color:#ffffff;">
        <img src="res/framework.png" title="RKNN"/>
    </center>

  In order to use RKNPU, users need to first run the RKNN-Toolkit2 tool on the computer, convert the trained model into an RKNN format model, and then inference on the development board using the RKNN C API or Python API.

- RKNN-Toolkit2 is a software development kit for users to perform model conversion, inference and performance evaluation on PC and Rockchip NPU platforms.

- RKNN-Toolkit-Lite2 provides Python programming interfaces for Rockchip NPU platform to help users deploy RKNN models and accelerate the implementation of AI applications.

- RKNN Runtime provides C/C++ programming interfaces for Rockchip NPU platform to help users deploy RKNN models and accelerate the implementation of AI applications.

- RKNPU kernel driver is responsible for interacting with NPU hardware. It has been open source and can be found in the Rockchip kernel code.
